        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine you’re playing a video game match online, and you’re randomly placed into a team. You might find a
            group of people you get along really well with, and you end up winning the match. But once you finish the
            match, you probably won’t ever find yourself playing with those people ever again.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might even load up another match and end up in a game with some “toxic” players ー people who act and
            speak negatively towards others in the game, whether it be a teammate or someone on the opposing side. This
            can alter your whole experience in a match, making it difficult to have fun or want to continue playing.
        </p>
        <h3 class="pov">
            Even though online games can connect us to a large variety of people, these connections are often shallow
            and sometimes negative, making it difficult to form meaningful relationships or feel any sense of community.
        </h3>

        <h2>Needfinding</h2>
        <p>
            We observed 3 different gamers attempt to make friends online on 3 different gaming platforms: League of
            Legends on PC, Call of Duty on PS4, and Smash Ultimate on Nintendo Switch. We found that the overall problem
            faced by gamers was building the initial relationship with others in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each of these games and platforms are built differently. League of Legends uses its own chat interface, Call
            of Duty uses audio communication, and Smash Ultimate has no platform for communication between players. Each
            of these platforms has their own challenges for making friends. In League of Legends, the participant had a
            difficult time getting teammates to talk as they were more driven to play than look at the chatbox. In Call
            of Duty, the participant found that some of their teammates had no headset or mic to communicate, while
            other teammates responded negatively to their attempts to make conversation. Lastly, the platform for
            Nintendo Switch does not allow for any kind of communication between users as the online platform is
            strictly gameplay based.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to bridge this gap in communication and build friendships, gamers need a way to find and talk to
            people with similar interests, gameplay styles, and most importantly, people who have a mutual desire to
            find friends.
        </p>

        <h2>Competitive Audit</h2>

            We performed a competitive analysis on 3 major relevant applications: Discord, Reddit, and Facebook groups.

        <p>
            From this competitive analysis, we hope to create an application that is more socially driven than these other
            platforms. Our end goal is for the user to be able to find friends by building one on one relationships based on 
            shared interests, without it being intimidating or overwhelming. Our hope for app is that it could be used in 
            conjunction with these other platforms, such as finding a friend and then being able to game with them through 
            Discord, or sharing Facebook or Reddit posts with these newfound friends.
        </p>

        <h2>Storyboarding</h2>
        <p>
            We created storyboards to visualize user needs and demonstrate the interactions needed to satisfy this need.
            Utilizing our storyboards, we created and refined our paper prototypes.
            <img src="images/bash/storyboard.png" width="65%">
        </p>

        <h2>Low-fidelity Prototypes</h2>
        <p>
            We created paper prototypes to demonstrate the workflow of our app. After conducting heuristic evaluations
            on these paper prototypes, we were able to use feedback when building our wireframe.
            <br><br>
            Examples of these improvements include:
        <ul>
            <li>Making the back button more descriptive so users know where they would be redirected to</li>
            <li>Not showing the navigation bar before users have selected game genres</li>
            <li>Allowing users to clear their selection of genres for user freedom</li>
            <li>Showing descriptive information about people the user matches with</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/bash/paper prototypes.png" style="width: 60%">
        <img src="images/bash/wireframes.png" style="width: 60%">
        </p>

        <h2>High-fidelity Prototypes</h2>
        <p>
            Our final prototype was scaled back due to time constraints, but still followed the general workflow of our
            paper prototype. On a user’s first login, they are prompted to select what video game genres they are
            interested in. From there, they are matched accordingly with other users. They can add these suggested users
            as friends and then begin chatting with them. Users are also able to update their genres of interest as well
            as add new friends. <br><br>

        </p>

        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>
            After creating our high fidelity prototype, we tested 3 people in our user base -- people who play video
            games. We recorded positive and negative feedback from our participants, as well as their breakdowns and
            successes while using the app.

            <li>Content doesn't refresh</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        We saw two main patterns among our users. One common behavior was an attempt to view someone’s profile when
        trying to add or message them, as this is a common feature of social media. Another pattern we observed was
        participants not being able to press buttons due to them being too small or not visible due to the other
        elements in the interface.
        <br><br>
        After testing, the changes we made to increase usability included:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0px;">
            <li>Fixing small bugs in implementation, such as user's password not being hidden</li>
            <li>Changing chat bubble colors to differentiate between sent and received messages</li>
            <li>Increasing size of buttons to reduce errors (back button, add button, and bottom navigation)</li>
            <li>Resizing layout elements so users would not have to scroll to see all options</li>
            <li>Showing mutual genres between users when suggesting friends</li>
            <li>Adding profile pages to suggested and added friends</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
        Other features we were not able to implement due to the scope and timeframe of the project, or not having the
        resources needed to implement, such as access to an API to simulate a fully functioning friend request system.
        </p>

        <h2>Alternate Designs</h2>
        <p>
            After performing user testing, we chose to redesign our suggestion page from friends and analyze it through
            A/B testing. As shown, we decided to change the page to show only the mutual genres shared between the
            suggested friends and the users.
            <br>
            <img src="images/bash/ab testing.png" width="55%">
            <br>
            In our A/B testing, we measured the number of times users clicked the “Add” button; our expected outcome was
            that users would choose to add more friends when they saw mutual genres because it would be more clear as to
            why the friends were suggested to them.
            <br><br>
            Using Google analytics to our test, we found that for page A, 27% of suggested friends were added by users,
            and for page B, 29% of suggested friends were added. We concluded that there was no statistically
            significant difference between the two designs because of how close the percentages are.
            <br><br>
            In the end, we still chose to keep page B in our final design due to user feedback we received. In addition,
            we support our decision from the assumption that similar to other social media, users tend to add or follow
            others who have common interests.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            We were able to publish our app as a working prototype. Unfortunately, due to time and resources, we were
            not able
            to create a fully functioning social app, so the friends and chat features are simulated. I hope to revisit
            this project
            and find a way to utilize API's and databases to allow for messaging between different users on the app.
